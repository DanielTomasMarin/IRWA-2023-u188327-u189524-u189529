Part-1

To execute this code, you have to follow the following steps:
-	First download the zip with the name IRWA-2023-part-1 that contains all the files of the lab. To do this click on the zip with that name, and it opens it in a new window, that in the right of the window appears an emoticon with the shape for download, and it says download raw file, and it will download and you will be able to open the folder.
-	When you open the folder, you will see 4 documents: 
    o	The first file is called IRWA-Project-2023-u188327-u189524-u189529-part-1.ipynb that is the code of our part 1.
    o	The second file has the name IRWA-2023-u188327-u189524-u189529-part-1 that is the pdf with all the explanations and our results of the lab
    o	The other 2 files that are called Rus_Ukr_war_data_ids are the ones containing the data, and one is in csv and one in json.
    
-	The first document that you have to open is the ipynb, and you have to open it in collab.
-	Once is open, in the left of the colab you will see an emoticon with the shape of a folder, so you must click there and under the folder that says sample_data(not inside, under) you have to upload the 2 files called Rus_Ukr_war_data_ids
-	When there are uploated you go to the cell that says execute all, and you press it because we distribute the cells of the code that makes sense and can be executed without problem.
-	When everything is executed you can see our results and our implementation of the code, and you can collaterally open the pdf to see our conclusions and why we have done everything.


Part-2

To execute this part of code, you have to follow the follwoing steps:
-  First download the zip with the name IRWA-2023-part-2 that contain all the files of the lab. To do this click on the zip with that name, and it opens it in a new window, that in the right of the window appears an emoticon with the shape for download, and it says download raw file, and it will download and you will be able to open the folder.
- When you open the folder, you will see 5 files:
    o   The first file is called IRWA-Project-2023-u188327-u189524-u189529-part-2.ipynb that is the code of our part 2 (but also contains the code of part 1 that you can display it or not, because it was already in the code of IRWA-Project-2023-u188327-u189524-u189529-part-1, but you have to execute all the code because there are some functions that we need from part 1 to part 2. The important part of this lab starts where it says Part 1 Lab2).
    o	The second file has the name IRWA-2023-u188327-u189524-u189529-part-2 that is the pdf with all the explanations and our results of the lab.
    o   The third file has the name Evaluation_gt and is a csv that contains the docs, the query id and the relevance of some documents that the statment needs (you will see why we use it in the code and in the pdf explaining everything.)
    o	The last 2 files that are called Rus_Ukr_war_data_ids are the ones containing the data, and one is in csv and one in json.
- Once is open, in the left of the colab you will see an emoticon with the shape of a folder, so you must click there and under the folder that says sample_data(not inside, under) you have to upload the 2 files called Rus_Ukr_war_data_ids and the file called Evaluation_gt.
-	When there are uploated you go to the cell that says execute all, and you press it because we distribute the cells of the code that makes sense and can be executed without problem.
-	When everything is executed you can see our results and our implementation of the code, and you can collaterally open the pdf to see our conclusions and why we have done everything.

Part-3

To execute this part of code, you have to follow the follwoing steps:
-  First download the zip with the name IRWA-2023-part-3 that contain all the files of the lab. To do this click on the zip with that name, and it opens it in a new window, that in the right of the window appears an emoticon with the shape for download, and it says download raw file, and it will download and you will be able to open the folder.
- When you open the folder, you will see 5 files:
    o   The first file is called IRWA-Project-2023-u188327-u189524-u189529-part-3.ipynb that is the code of our part 3 (but also contains the code of part 1 and part 2 that you can display it or not, because it was already in the code of IRWA-Project-2023-u188327-u189524-u189529-part-1 and IRWA-Project-2023-u188327-u189524-u189529-part-2, but you have to execute all the code because there are some functions that we need from part 1 and part 2 to part 3. The important part of this lab starts where it says Lab 3).
    o	The second file has the name IRWA-2023-u188327-u189524-u189529-part-3 that is the pdf with all the explanations and our results of the lab.
    o   The third file has the name Evaluation_gt and is a csv that contains the docs, the query id and the relevance of some documents that the statment needs (you will see why we use it in the code and in the pdf explaining everything.)
    o	The last 2 files that are called Rus_Ukr_war_data_ids are the ones containing the data, and one is in csv and one in json.
- Once is open, in the left of the colab you will see an emoticon with the shape of a folder, so you must click there and under the folder that says sample_data(not inside, under) you have to upload the 2 files called Rus_Ukr_war_data_ids and the file called Evaluation_gt.
-	When there are uploated you go to the cell that says execute all, and you press it because we distribute the cells of the code that makes sense and can be executed without problem.
-	When everything is executed you can see our results and our implementation of the code, and you can collaterally open the pdf to see our conclusions and why we have done everything.
IMPORTANT: the execution of all files lasts more or less 18minutes as we have to run the code of the 3 labs to work with part 3.

Part-4

To execute this part of the code, you need to follow the following steps:
First, download the zip file named "IRWA-2023-part-4" containing all the lab files. To do this, click on the zip file with that name, and it will open in a new window. On the right side of the window, an emoticon with the shape for download will appear. Click on "download raw file," and it will download the zip file. You can then open the folder.
- When you open the folder, you will find 2 files:
    o   The first one is a folder called "p4_final." Open this folder and navigate to the following path: "p4_final/p4_irwa/search-engine-web-app." Once inside this folder, open the terminal with this path and execute the following line of code: python web_app.py. When you execute this in your terminal, you may need to install some libraries. If everything is correct, your terminal will display an IP like this: http://127.0.0.1:8088. Click on this link, and our work will appear. If you have a Mac, it might open the path like this: http://0.0.0.0:8088. In that case, you will need to manually change the link to resemble the first one when you click on it. Once all of this is done, you can try and explore any tweet you want.
    o   The second file is named "IRWA-2023-u188327-u189524-u189529-part-4." This is the PDF with all the explanations, our results of the lab, and the procedure that we followed to complete everything.

With all done you can see our evolution of the projects and each part what we achieve and develope to obatin this final part 4.
