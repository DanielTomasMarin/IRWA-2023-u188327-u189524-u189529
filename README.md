To execute this code, you have to follow the following steps:
-	First download the zip with the name IRWA-2023-part-1 that contains all the files of the lab. To do this click on the zip with that name, and it opens it in a new window, that in the right of the window appears an emoticon with the shape for download, and it says download raw file, and it will download and you will be able to open the folder.
-	When you open the folder, you will see 4 documents: 
    o	The first file is called IRWA-Project-2023-u188327-u189524-u189529-part-1.ipynb that is the code of our part 1.
    o	The second file has the name IRWA-2023-u188327-u189524-u189529-part-1 that is the pdf with all the explanations and our results of the lab
    o	The other 2 files that are called Rus_Ukr_war_data_ids are the ones containing the data, and one is in csv and one in json.
    
-	The first document that you have to open is the ipynb, and you have to open it in collab.
-	Once is open, in the left of the colab you will see an emoticon with the shape of a folder, so you must click there and under the folder that says sample_data(not inside, under) you have to upload the 2 files called Rus_Ukr_war_data_ids
-	When there are uploated you go to the cell that says execute all, and you press it because we distribute the cells of the code that makes sense and can be executed without problem.
-	When everything is executed you can see our results and our implementation of the code, and you can collaterally open the pdf to see our conclusions and why we have done everything.
